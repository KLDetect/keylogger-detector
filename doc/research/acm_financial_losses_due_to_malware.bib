abstract = {General survey stat that the main damage malware can cause is to slow down their PCs and perhaps crash some websites which is quite wrong, The Russian antivirus software developer teamed up with B2B International for a study worldwide recently, shown 36\% of users lose money online as a result of a malware attack. Currently malware can't be detected by traditional way based anti-malware tools due to their polymorphic and/or metamorphic nature. Here we have improvised a current detection technique of malware based on mining Application Programming Interface (API) calls and developed the first public dataset to promote malware research.• In survey of cyber-attacks 6.2\% financial attacks are due to malware which increase to 1.3 \% in 2013 compared to 2012.• Financial data theft causes 27.6\% to reach 28,400,000. Victims abused by this targeting malware countered 3,800,000, which is 18.6\% greater than previous year.• Finance-committed malware, associated with Bitcoin has demonstrated the most dynamic development. Where's, Zeus is still top listed for playing important roles to steal banking credentials.Solutionary study stats that companies are spending a staggering amount of money in the aftermath of damaging attack: DDoS attacks recover $6,500 per hour from malware and more than $3,000 each time for up to 30 days to moderate and improve from malware attacks.
